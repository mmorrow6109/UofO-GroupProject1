## Details

For this assignment, we created a mock-booking app that allows the user to book reservations at restuarants in Portland, OR and its greater area.  The app tries to utilize both the Yelp API as well as Google Translate, however the final product is only using Yelp as we ran into some paywall issues.  The concept was based on there being a massive amount of restaurants in a relatively small metropolitan area.  With 'Book and Dine PDX'tourists and locals alike can hop on the app, search for exactly what they're in the mood for, and be presented with the 20 best options the city has to offer.  To make the app more accessible, we wanted the page to be translated to Spanish with the click of a button.
